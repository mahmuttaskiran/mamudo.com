I am a professional programmer specialized mobile applications and tools. I developed and still developing Android native applications with Java and Kotlin, and cross platform applications with Flutter and React-Native. I experienced developing social media applications, IoT applications, sensor based applications, and one application which using WebRTC technology.

I am learning new and innovator programming languages and paradigms just like Rust even if I donâ€™t work any related project with it. I have been focused on developing my programming skills rather than learning new programming languages. Because I believe that programming is a thinking art, so if I improve my programming knowledge I can think better.

I have been developed applications with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) principles.

I like to think about how can I improve customer experience with UI and UX skills and I am working on UI and UX as a hobby.
