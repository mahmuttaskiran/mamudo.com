I am a professional programmer specializing in mobile applications and tools. I have experience developing native Android applications using Java and Kotlin, as well as cross-platform applications using Flutter and React-Native. My expertise includes developing social media applications using React-Native and Flutter, IoT applications using Flutter and Java, sensor-based applications using Java, and WebRTC-based applications using React-Native.

I strongly believe that programming is an art of thinking, and my focus has been on enhancing my programming skills rather than learning new languages. By continuously improving my knowledge, I can think more effectively and deliver innovative solutions. As a skilled and adaptable developer, I am eager to contribute my expertise to new projects and challenges.
